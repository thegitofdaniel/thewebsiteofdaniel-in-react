        I have developed awesome projects to clients in Brazil, Canada, Germany, Mexico, The
        Netherlands, and Switzerland. By assessing the root cause of their challenges and choosing
        the best technology, I&apos;ve unlocked value and positive change. I&apos;ve made a tangible impact on
        both my clients&apos; success and the broader landscape of innovation. It&apos;s a journey fueled by
        passion and purpose, and I&apos;m excited to continue making strides in this ever-evolving field.

        Since 2020, I&apos;ve played a pivotal role in building greenfield Data Platforms to enable
        large-caps on AIML and maximize the value derived from data. My contributions include
        developing models for Energy and Gas consumption using Azure Machine Learning, utilizing
        state-of-the-art algorithms to input missing data, establishing MLOPS processes for model
        deployment, implementing robust data pipelines, and introducing agile methodologies to
        strengthen team collaboration.

        In addition to my core responsibilities, I&apos;ve also been actively involved in fostering a
        culture of continuous learning and innovation within the teams I&apos;ve worked with. This has
        included organizing knowledge-sharing sessions, conducting workshops on emerging
        technologies and best practices, and mentoring junior team members to help them grow their
        skills and expertise in data science and machine learning. Furthermore, I&apos;ve been
        instrumental in fostering strong cross-functional relationships between data science,
        engineering, and business stakeholders, ensuring alignment of objectives and effective
        communication channels throughout project life-cycles. By championing a collaborative and
        growth-oriented environment, I&apos;ve helped foster a sense of ownership and accountability
        among team members, resulting in greater efficiency and success in achieving our project
        goals.
